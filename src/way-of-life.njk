          <p class="mb-4">
            I founded One Kansei after working with startups where I constantly found myself solving symptoms rather than root causes. Despite my attempts to address systems-level problems, the pressure to 'keep the boat sailing' meant most solutions were band-aids on extractive models.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            This experience taught me something crucial: real transformation requires partners who are ready to question their entire system, not just optimize it. It also reminded me that approaching complex challenges with a beginner's mindset often reveals solutions that expertise alone might miss.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            That's why we work with carefully selected clients who embrace uncertainty and are willing to redesign from the ground up. Sometimes the most profound changes come from admitting we don't have all the answers and starting fresh.
