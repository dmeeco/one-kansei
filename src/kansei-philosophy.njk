      <!-- Introduction -->
      <div class="bg-light border-start border-4 border-primary p-4 mb-4 rounded-end">
        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Kansei (感性)</strong> is a Japanese concept representing mental activity that encompasses sensation, perception, cognition, emotion, and thinking. More than just sensitivity, Kansei is "perception with impression" — intuitive intelligence that bridges rational analysis with human experience.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">At Kansei Design, this philosophy guides our approach to climate solutions. We believe sustainable innovation succeeds when it resonates with both human nature and environmental needs, creating solutions people naturally want to embrace.</p>

        <h2 class="h3 fw-semibold text-dark mb-3 pb-2 border-bottom">Understanding Kansei</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Kansei relates to mental activity or ability, especially to cognitive processes such as sensation, perception, cognition, emotion, and thinking. According to leading researcher Kayo Miura, Kansei encompasses <mark class="bg-warning bg-opacity-25 px-1">"evaluative ability which is done unconsciously, intuitively and with an information-integrative manner"</mark> and serves as <mark class="bg-warning bg-opacity-25 px-1">"the mental activity of creation and expression."</mark></p>
        
        <div class="bg-light p-4 rounded">
          <p class="fw-semibold mb-3">Kansei represents several key capabilities:</p>
          
          <div class="mb-3">
            <h4 class="h6 fw-medium text-dark mb-2">Intuitive judgment in complex, ambiguous situations</h4>
            <p class="mb-0 small">The ability to make sound decisions when complete information is unavailable, drawing from both conscious analysis and unconscious pattern recognition.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mb-3">
            <h4 class="h6 fw-medium text-dark mb-2">Integrated perception that combines logic with feeling</h4>
            <p class="mb-0 small">A holistic approach that honors both rational evaluation and emotional intelligence in understanding complex systems.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mb-3">
            <h4 class="h6 fw-medium text-dark mb-2">Creative insight that emerges from holistic understanding</h4>
            <p class="mb-0 small">Innovation that arises from seeing connections and patterns that purely analytical approaches might miss.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mb-0">
            <h4 class="h6 fw-medium text-dark mb-2">Adaptive response based on impression and evaluation</h4>
            <p class="mb-0 small">The capacity to respond flexibly to changing circumstances while maintaining alignment with deeper values and objectives.</p>

        <h2 class="h3 fw-semibold text-dark mb-3 pb-2 border-bottom">From Philosophy to Practice</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Kansei represents higher brain function related to emotion, intuition, creativity, feeling, and affection — qualities essential for addressing complex challenges like climate change. Kansei engineering parametrically links emotional responses to product properties and characteristics, enabling designs that bring forward intended feelings.</p>

        <h2 class="h3 fw-semibold text-dark mb-3 pb-2 border-bottom">Why This Matters for Climate Solutions</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Climate challenges require solutions that work technically and connect with people emotionally. Kansei's <mark class="bg-warning bg-opacity-25 px-1">"quick and adaptive judgment based on impression"</mark> enables us to create innovations that feel right to users — making sustainable choices not just logical, but natural and desirable.</p>
        
        <blockquote class="border-start border-4 border-secondary ps-4 fst-italic text-muted mb-4">
          "When climate solutions align with human Kansei, adoption accelerates. People do not just understand why they should change; they want to change."
        </blockquote>
        
        <p class="mb-3">This emotional alignment creates the momentum necessary for widespread transformation.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-0">Sustainable innovation must account for the full spectrum of human experience. Technical excellence alone cannot drive the behavioral shifts required for climate action. Solutions must resonate with human nature, creating positive emotional associations that reinforce continued use and advocacy.</p>
