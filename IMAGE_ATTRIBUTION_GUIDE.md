# Image Attribution Guide

This guide explains how to add image attribution to your blog posts and projects using Tina CMS.

## Overview

The image attribution feature allows you to properly credit image sources with a small, elegant attribution overlay that appears on the bottom-left corner of images.

## How to Use

### 1. Cover Image Attribution

When editing a blog post or project in Tina CMS, you'll now see two new fields:

- **Cover Image Attribution**: Enter the attribution text (e.g., "Designed by Freepik")
- **Cover Image Attribution URL**: Enter the URL for the attribution link (e.g., "https://www.freepik.com")

### 2. Rich Text Image Attribution

In the rich-text editor, you can now add images with attribution using the "Image with Attribution" template:

1. Click the "+" button in the rich-text editor
2. Select "Image with Attribution"
3. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Image URL**: The URL of the image
   - **Alt Text**: Descriptive text for accessibility
   - **Attribution Text**: The attribution text (e.g., "Designed by Freepik")
   - **Attribution URL**: The URL for the attribution link (e.g., "https://www.freepik.com")

## Attribution Format

The attribution will appear as:
- **Text**: "Designed by Freepik" (or your custom text)
- **Link**: Clickable link to the source website
- **Style**: Small, semi-transparent overlay on the bottom-left corner of the image

## Examples

### Freepik Attribution
- Attribution Text: `Designed by Freepik`
- Attribution URL: `https://www.freepik.com`

### Pexels Attribution
- Attribution Text: `Photo by Pexels`
- Attribution URL: `https://www.pexels.com`

### Unsplash Attribution

## Technical Details

- The attribution appears as a small overlay on the bottom-left corner of images
- It has a semi-transparent dark background for readability
- The text is white and includes a hover effect

- The attribution is responsive and works on all screen sizes

## Best Practices

1. **Always credit the source**: Even if not legally required, it's good practice to credit image creators
2. **Use descriptive attribution**: Include the platform name and photographer if available
3. **Provide working links**: Ensure the attribution URL is correct and accessible
4. **Keep it concise**: Attribution text should be brief but informative
